# name-draw
A fun Shiny app that draws a name and shows you a random IMDB move plot that contains that name.

My office asked me to use R to "pick a name from a hat" during our holiday Zoom party. So, of course, I made a Shiny app for it, and I made it do more than pick a name.

When you click the "Pick Winner" button, the app picks a team member's name and queries IMDB movie plot summaries that contain that name. The app picks one of the summaries at random and shows it in the app but keeps the movie title hidden. Click the reveal button to reveal the move title. Play as many times as you want!
I removed the names of my office mates.

This app currently uses a random selection of names from the RStudio employee page ;) What movies does Hadley appear in?
